## Source code for HTML-site on colpaert.org and abandoned.be

Homemade HTML website based on a bootstrap skeleton with Supersized jQuery plugin for fullscreen slideshow of images.

After maintaining several blogs and websites over the last 10 years I decided not to invest in an own CMS-based portfolio site for now. Since all my latest and best pictures end up on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/koencolpaert/) anyway I just direct my audience that way. The pictures on this slideshow are getting updated from time to time and the "Enter"-button brings you to my Instagram-feed. I also provided two social media buttons; one pointing at my  [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/Abandonedbe/) and another at my [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/kcolpaert).

My entire workflow is build around Instagram: every new picture on Instagram is picked up by several IFTTT-jobs[^1] handling the cross-posting of the same image to my Facebook-page, my Twitter-feed and my [Tumblr](http://knclprt.tumblr.com/). Yes, you can call me lazy ;-)
